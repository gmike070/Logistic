# Customer Orders, Sales, and Loyalty Dataset using python

## Objective

To analyze customer orders, loyalty, and operational efficiency in order to identify sales patterns, customer retention drivers, and operational bottlenecks, ultimately helping the business improve revenue, reduce churn, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statements


1. Which product categories contribute the most to sales, and how can the company focus marketing strategies accordingly?

2. Does applying a coupon code significantly affect customer loyalty scores, and what does this mean for promotional strategies?

3. Which regions or cities show the highest return rates, and how can logistics or product quality be improved to minimize returns?

## Setting up the environment
Installing the required libraries:

•	We need Numpy for mathematical operation

•	Pandas for Dataframe Manipulation

•	Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization

•	And finally Jupyter Notebook to build an interactive ipython notebook

Python Code (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Import Libraries
 ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
 ```

Step 2: Load and Inspect the Dataset Python:

Step 3: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Python code:

Analysis 1 Top product categories by total sales 



Analysis 2 Coupon vs No Coupon LoyaltyScore 



Analysis 3 Return rates by Region

## Recommendations

I. For Product Sales: Focus marketing campaigns on the top 2–3 performing categories, while also investigating why lower-selling categories underperform (pricing, demand, or distribution issues).

II. For Coupons & Loyalty: Since coupon users show higher loyalty scores, consider targeted coupon campaigns for low-loyalty or high-churn-risk customers.

III. For Returns: In regions/cities with high return rates, investigate product quality issues, delivery problems, or mismatched customer expectations. Partner with logistics teams to optimize shipping methods and reduce delays.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights how sales, loyalty, and returns vary across products, promotions, and regions. By leveraging coupons strategically, focusing on best-selling categories, and addressing return-heavy areas, the company can increase revenue, improve customer retention, and reduce operational inefficiencies.
