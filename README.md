## Objective

To analyze customer orders, loyalty, and operational efficiency in order to identify sales patterns, customer retention drivers, and operational bottlenecks, ultimately helping the business improve revenue, reduce churn, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statements


1. Which product categories contribute the most to sales, and how can the company focus marketing strategies accordingly?

2. Does applying a coupon code significantly affect customer loyalty scores, and what does this mean for promotional strategies?

3. Which regions or cities show the highest return rates, and how can logistics or product quality be improved to minimize returns?





## Recommendations

I. For Product Sales: Focus marketing campaigns on the top 2â€“3 performing categories, while also investigating why lower-selling categories underperform (pricing, demand, or distribution issues).

II. For Coupons & Loyalty: Since coupon users show higher loyalty scores, consider targeted coupon campaigns for low-loyalty or high-churn-risk customers.

III. For Returns: In regions/cities with high return rates, investigate product quality issues, delivery problems, or mismatched customer expectations. Partner with logistics teams to optimize shipping methods and reduce delays.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights how sales, loyalty, and returns vary across products, promotions, and regions. By leveraging coupons strategically, focusing on best-selling categories, and addressing return-heavy areas, the company can increase revenue, improve customer retention, and reduce operational inefficiencies.
